      the pattern is <a href="">My favourite fashion sweater</a>, and is the first jumper I ever attempted to make. I regret choosing this pattern. It's fine and good enough but i hate sewing and it will at some point involve sewing. My next jumper will be top-down. Or the octopus sweater that I bought the pattern for.
